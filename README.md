# SCHEDULE DASHBOARD

I am so bored when I attend venues for my thesis or exams or even conference rooms, I cam't really know what realy is going inside one might enter inside and fing other members are taking a certain busy schedule to avoid this, a simple designated screen (Tv) could be set outside of the conference room to allow external members to know exactly whayt going on.

# Procedures

Add the given room schedules  
Update and delete the given schedules
This schedules will be displayed in outside monitors of the given room realtime showing what schedule is taking place and what schedule was before that.
